      <h2>How to Survive School</h2>
      <p>To survive school at BLS, there are several things you need to do. These things are to find your way around your school, manage your time, and set times to go 
        to your locker.<br><strong>1. Figure out how to get places</strong><br>To get to your classes on time, you will need to find your way around the school. To find 
        your classes,the one thing you need to remember is that all of the rooms are stacked on top of each other. Room 235 is directly above room 135,and room 135 is 
        on top of room 035. To find classes that are up or down a floor, find the room on the floor you're on, and go up or down to it on the nearest staircase. Also, 
        don't be afraid to ask for directions. Finally, most importantly, find out where the bathrooms are!<br><strong>2. Manage your time</strong><br>One of the most 
        important things you have to do to survive school is to manage your time. You usually get about a half hour of homework every day in each subject. When you get 
        home from school every day,you should start your homework as soon as possible. Use your planner and check google classroom to make sure what your homework is, 
        and do as much as you can of it in studies.<br><strong>3. Times to go to your locker</strong><br>In seventh grade, you have set times to go to your locker, but 
        even if you're in a higher grade, you should still keep those set times. Go to your locker before homeroom, after R2, and after R4, when you get your lunch (R5 
        is lunch, and if you forget your lunch, you can't go back to your locker). You should also go after R5 and after R7 (last period).</p>
        <h3>Things to know</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three lunch periods at BLS. They all take place during R5, and will change every trimester (if you have 1st lunch the first trimester, then you 
            will have 2nd lunch the second trimester).</li>
          <li>If you get to school before 7:25, you wait in the dining hall until then. You can go to homeroom after 7:25, but no later than 7:40.</li>
          <li>Wednesdays are W days. On W days, you go directly to R1 and go back to homeroom after R2.</li>
          <li>BLS runs on a 6 day rotating schedule.</li>
