evan game idea
 
 - unprofessional
 - arrived late

2d game like mario type thing
the world has no color
 - just grey
main character has a robot companion
has to get a gem in order to restore color to the world

 - evan is at september event
 - unprofessional
 - he does not speak when spoken to
 - leaves call from tennis court

where are the profits

once you get the gem there is a final bossfight which is in color

 - geoffery has learned a bunch of green day songs
 - possible profits but unlikely

combine the two games into one big game
do not do
no relation between games
no profit

 - claims unity is the best engine for 2d games
 - baseless claims with no evidence
 - no profit

final game will be constructed in pygame or godot

evan is here now

evan pitch:
 - there is this guy
 - steals this gem
 - 2d platformer pixel art style
 - probably not as hard to make as farmer -> PROFIT
 - steals gem from museam
 - he is in color
 - everything else is like sketch except him and gem
 - has to go through flatlands, sea, and forest to return the gem to a pedestal in cloud kingdom
 - then the world turns into color for bossfight

as you progress through each biome you gain different colors?
unlock all colors at end?

combine farmer with this?
character is farmer, all enemies from farmer?
no

 - final thing is in cloud kingdom
 - return gem to pedestal in cloud kingdom

geoffery is in a grave situation
 - unprofessional
 - no profit

geoffery disses evans dads band
 - unprofessional
 - no profit

geoferry and evan are going to get kidnapped by some people
 - profit?

geoffery hits head on windowsill
 - unprofessional
 - no healthcare -> loss in profits

shared document with ideas to be created
this concludes the meeting
